## System Software and Microprocessors Experiments
Hands-on experience in how microcontrollers and microprocessors can be programmed is something I gained while learning System Software and Microprocessors during my college days.
In this experiment, I familiarized myself with assembly-level programming of microprocessors and microcontrollers, interfacing devices with microcontrollers, 
resource allocation algorithms in operating systems, and the design and implementation of system software.

### Implemented the below concepts using C

#### non-preemptive CPU Scheduling Algorithms (non-preemptive-CSA)
- FCFS 
- SJF 
- Round Robin (pre-emptive) 
- Priority



#### Disk Scheduling Algorithms (DSA)
- FCFS
- SCAN
- C-SCAN

#### Page Replacement Algorithms (PRA)
- FIFO
- LRU 
- LFU

#### Assemblers
- pass one of a two pass assembler

#### Loaders
- absolute loader
- relocating loader
